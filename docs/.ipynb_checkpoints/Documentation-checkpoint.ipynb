    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "The AD20 package performs the forward mode of automatic differentiation of user defined functions, evaluating both the function and its derivatives to machine precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Automatic Differentiation as a Solution to the Problem of Computing Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiation is a fundamental operation for computational science. Used in a variety of applications from optimization to sensitivity analysis, differentiation is most useful when two conditions are met: it must be exact (up to machine precision) and computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation (AD) (i.e. algorithmic differentiation, computational differentiation) computes the derivative of a function, unique for its ability to handle complex combinations of functions without sacrificing the accuracy. Regardless of how complex the function may be, AD takes advantage of the fact that the function can be decomposed into a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "Through computing the derivatives of these basic elementary functions and repeatedly applying the chain rule, AD meets the two aforementioned conditions and distinguishes itself from other modes of differentiation, namely numerical differentiation and symbolic differentiation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Numerical Differentiation through Finite Difference Methods:** \n",
    "This class of techniques uses the definition of a derivative,\n",
    "$$\\frac{df(x)}{dt} = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$\n",
    "to approximate the derivative by evaluating the right hand side for small $h$.  Such a technique is easy to code because it requires only defining and evaluating $f$, but it has limitations in precision due to truncation and roundoff errors, alongside the challenge of choosing an appropriately sized $h$.  While more complex finite difference schemes have been used to increase accuracy, all numerical differentiation remains only approximate with sensitivity to the choice in step size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symbolic Differentiation:**\n",
    "Symbolic differentiation addresses the shortcomings of approximation in numerical differentiation by computing derivatives to machine precision using expression trees, which quickly become inefficient to compute. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these options have been used in a variety of different applications to compute derivatives, but both have shortcomings that are addressed by automatic differentiation.  For this reason, for many computational applications, automatic differentiation is preferred:\n",
    "\n",
    "- While numerical differentiation may be easy to implement and can flexibly handle any type of function, accuracy is sacrificed due to truncation and rounding errors - numerical differentiation serves more as an estimation technique based on small inputs. Unlike numerical differentiation, automatic differentiation does not rely on approximating the derivative through the choice of a small perturbation in the input, and instead computes derivatives exactly to machine precision, thus avoiding these accuracy and stability problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- While symbolic differentiation may ensure accuracy up to machine precision, computational efficiency is sacrified due to the nature of building complex expression trees. For complex functions, these expression trees can quickly become very large with many mathematical expressions. Unlike symbolic differentiation, automatic differentiation views functions as compositions of basic operations, remains accurate up to machine precision, and maintains computational efficiency since it does not require the buildup and evaluation of complex expression trees.\n",
    " \n",
    "Thus, it is clear that automatic differentiation has advantages over other commonly used techniques for computing derivatives. These advantages make the use of AD attractive to many scientific applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Application of AD Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Through its improved accuracy and efficiency, AD has many different applications where accuracy, precision, and efficiency is crucial in computation. Some potential applications include: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine learning (ability to understand data and make models/predictions), where backpropagation is used to parameterize neural nets among other parameter optimization techniques\n",
    "- Parameter optimization (ability to choose best parameter values under given conditions), where methods requiring derivatives may be used to find the optima\n",
    "- Sensitivity analysis (ability to understand different factors and their impact), which requires computing partial derivatives with respect to different inputs and parameters\n",
    "- Physical modeling (ability to visualize and depict data through models), where different physical properties are related through derivatives (for example, acceleration is the derivative of velocity)\n",
    "- Probabilistic inference, where many sampling methods (for example, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) are derivative based\n",
    "\n",
    "This large range of applications motivates the development of a package that can easily be used to compute derivatives up to machine precision efficiently, precisely the problem solved by automatic differentiation."

    "# 2. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we discuss the mathematical concepts and computational process needed to perform automatic differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 The Chain Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule forms the core concept behind automatic differentiation.  The chain rule gives the formula for calculating derivates of a composition of functions by sequentially taking derivatives of the outermost to innermost function.  The chain rule gives us that for a function $f\\left(g\\left(t\\right)\\right)$, we find the derivative of $f$ with respect to $t$ by multiplying a series of derivatives,\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial g}\\dfrac{\\partial g}{\\partial t}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, AD performs differentiation by decomposing complex functions into combinations of simpler, more elementary functions then computing the derivatives of the elementary functions to piece them together to get the overall derivative. By expressing the function as a composition of elementary functions and operations, the derivative of the function can be calculated by applying the chain rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule can be generalized to multiple dimensions, just as automatic differentiation can compute gradients of functions of multiple inputs.  For example, for the function $f(g(u, v), h(u, v))$, we have\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} = \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial g}\\dfrac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} + \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial h}\\dfrac{\\partial h}{\\partial u}$$\n",
    "and \n",
    "$$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial v} = \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial g}\\dfrac{\\partial g}{\\partial v} + \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial h}\\dfrac{\\partial h}{\\partial v}$$\n",
    "where the gradient is given by\n",
    "$$\\nabla f = \\left(\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial u}, \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial v}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the most general form, we have for $f(g(x))$ with $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ and $g \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla_x f = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial g{i}}\\nabla_x g_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Graph Structure of Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentation computes derivatives by constructing a function through a sequence of elementary operations and functions.  We can visualize the process of constructing a function in this way through a computational graph, where the nodes are functions and the directed edges describe the computations which connect the nodes.  By tracing a path from the input nodes to the output final function, we trace the same computations which are done by the automatic differentiation method to evaluate the function and its derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: The Computational Graph\n",
    "Consider the example function $$f\\left(x,y\\right) = x^{3} + \\sin(5y)$$\n",
    "evaluated at $(x,y) = (1, \\frac{\\pi}{5})$.\n",
    "\n",
    " The evaluation trace looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![comp-table](figs/comptable.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation trace can be visualized with a computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "![comp-graph](figs/compgraphppt.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the same fundamental process, building complex functions through the composition of elementary functions, automatic differentiation computes derivatives exactly to machine precision.  Our package exploits different data structures, classes, and methods to implement this technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Dual Numbers\n",
    "Analogously to complex numbers, a dual number has a real part and a dual part.  We write $$f = y + \\epsilon y^{\\prime},$$ where $y$ is the real part and $y^{\\prime}$ is the dual part.  The number $\\epsilon$ is defined as a special constant such that $\\epsilon^{2} = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties of Dual Numbers\n",
    "Again by analogy to complex numbers, we can define several properties of the dual numbers, which are useful in performing calculations with them:\n",
    "* Conjugate:  $f^{*} = y - \\epsilon y^{\\prime}$.\n",
    "* Magnitude: $\\left|f\\right|^{2} = ff^{*} = \\left(y+\\epsilon y^{\\prime}\\right)\\left(y-\\epsilon y^{\\prime}\\right) = y^{2}$.\n",
    "* Polar form: $f = y\\left(1 + \\dfrac{y^{\\prime}}{y}\\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More significantly, the dual numbers have the property that they can be used to compute derivatives of functions.  If we wish to compute the derivative of $f(x)$, the real part of $f(x+x'\\epsilon)$ gives us the value of the function while the dual part gives us the value of the derivative as can be seen in the following example from lecture,\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "Let $f(z)=z^{2}$.  We know that the derivative is $f^{\\prime}(z) = 2zz^{\\prime} = 2z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider instead evaluating, $f(z+z'\\epsilon)$, where we have extended z to the dual numbers, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f = \\left(z + \\epsilon z^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}$$\n",
    "$$= z^{2} + 2zz'\\epsilon + z'^{2}\\epsilon^{2} $$\n",
    "Since $\\epsilon^2 = 0$, \n",
    "$$ = z^{2} + 2zz^{\\prime}\\epsilon $$\n",
    "$$ = f(z) + f'(z)\\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where we see that the real part is just the original function and the dual part is the derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "While our implementation of automatic differentiation does not use dual numbers explicitly, it is inspired by this structure.  Each object that we evaluate will contain an attribute of its value, corresponding to the real part of a dual number, and an attribute for its derivative, corresponding to the dual part of a dual number.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.4 Elementary Functions\n",
    "Any complex equation can be broken into combinations of elementary operations and functions. The elementary operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.  The elementary functions include the natural exponential, the natural logarithm, and the trigonometric functions.  These functions are considered elementary because they form the core set of elements used to build more complex functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know how to explicitly compute the derivatives of both elementary operations and functions, given by the standard set of calculus rules.  We will not go into details about how to calculate the derivatives of those functions here, but more information can be found on the following link.\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.nabla.hr/FU-DerivativeA5.htm\n",
    "\n",
    "Because every function is composed of elementary functions and we can take the derivative of a composition of functions by applying the chain rule, we can take the derivative of any function by knowing the derivative of these elementary functions.  It is this principle that forms the core of the automatic differentiation algorithm, implemented in this package.\n"

    "## 3.1 User Interaction\n",
    "Users should use `ADnum` objects to represent mathematical objects for which they would like to evaluate a value or a derivative.  By forming `ADnum` objects for the function inputs, the elementary operations and functions defined for the `ADnum` class can be composed to create any desired function, which will also be of the `ADnum` class, with associated value and derivative attributes. All operations are defined for an `ADnum` object. Users need to create an `ADnum` object for each input variable and use all the mathematical functions defined in the `ADmath` library to implement special functions.\n",
